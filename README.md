## Overview

This project focuses on building a CNN model to classify images into four categories. The pipeline involves:

1. Loading and preprocessing the data.
2. Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
3. Building a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
4. Training and evaluating the model.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 3,224 images belonging to 4 classes. Ensure that the images are organized in a folder structure like this:
