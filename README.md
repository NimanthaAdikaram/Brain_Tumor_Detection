Deep Learning Brain Tumor Detection Project
Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that there are three distinct categories of tumors, which develop gradually and are initially hard to detect. To address this, I developed a solution for brain tumor detection using MRI scans and a dataset of over 3000 images to build a Convolutional Neural Network.
